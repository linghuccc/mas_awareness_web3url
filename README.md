## About MAS Awareness NFT Project

The MAS awareness NFT project is an NFT project on BSC chain meant to raise fund for my daughter (an MAS patient) and a local MAS fundation, at the same time, to raise public awareness against McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS) - a rare disease.

The project consists of a total of 10,000 NFTs, with each NFT priced at 0.09 BNB. My daughter Yolanda and I co-designed and hand-drew all the parts of the NFT.

This project was online since end of April but due to lack of publicity, it is still barely known. The production site is at https://www.mas-awareness.top/.

## Further Improvements

Considering to convert MAS awareness NFT to composable NFT.
