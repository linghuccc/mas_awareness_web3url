						She was born on August 2018. I was standing by the
						obstetric delivery bed when she was born. At that time,
						I didn't fully understand the significance of the black
						birthmarks on her body. The picture on the left was
						taken on the day she was born. Despite being asleep, she
						had her fists clenched and her arms raised, as if ready
						to fight. Neither she nor I knew that she would have to
						battle MAS for the rest of her life.

						When Yolanda was 4 months old, her skin was allergic to
						a body cream and we took her to see a doctor. The doctor
						noticed the black birthmarks on her body and mentioned
						that they were not a good sign, but couldn't provide
						further details. So, we remained unaware of what lay
						ahead until Yolanda turned 6 months old.

				When Yolanda was 6 months old, my wife noticed blood in her
				diaper while changing it. We got panic and took her to the
				hospital. After consulting multiple doctors and undergoing
				thorough examinations, we received the heart-wrenching news that
				she had MAS. Despite being in the best child hospital in the
				province, there was no cure or treatment available since MAS is
				a rare disease, and the doctors lacked experience in dealing
				with it.

					<div class="mt-2 indent-8 justified-paragraph">
						Time passed, and apart from the black birthmarks,
						Yolanda grew up just like any other kid and turned 2
						years old. The picture on the right was taken when she
						was happily playing with her elder sister one day before
						she broke her left thigh (Yolanda is on the right). The
						next day, while running happily from the bedroom to the
						living room, she fell to the ground and cried out aloud.
						As soon as I heard her cry, I knew the injury must be
						serious. Because despite being my younger daughter,
						Yolanda had always been the tough-minded one in the
						family and rarely cry over little injuries. The moment I
						picked her up from the ground, I knew immediately that
						her bones must have been broken. We took her to the
						hospital but the doctors told us that her bones were
						hollowed, similar to tofu. And they couldn't perform
						surgery as it could lead to further fractures. Yolanda
						spent two weeks in the hospital with only skin traction
						before being discharged. She continued lying in bed at
						home for a few more weeks.

						Fortunately, Yolanda recovered from the incident and was
						able to walk later. However, due to the bone fracture,
						her left and right thighbones are not of equal length,
						resulting in a slight limp. Yolanda was too young to
						fully comprehend the situation, and she remained happy
						as usual. The picture on the left was taken in February
						2021 while she was playing with her elder sister
						(Yolanda is on the right).
					</div>
					<div class="mt-4 indent-8 justified-paragraph">
						After returning from the hospital, I started searching
						for more information about MAS and see what else we
						could do for Yolanda. Fortunately I found some support
						groups for MAS patients and connected with other
						parents. We shared information about doctors and
						hospitals specializing in MAS treatment. It was through
						this group that I learned about a doctor in a hospital
						300 km away who had experience treating MAS patients. In
						July 2021, I took Yolanda to see this doctor for the
						first time and injected bisphosphonates for her to
						increase her bone density. At first the injection was
						scheduled every 6 months, and later changed to every 3
						months.

					<div class="mt-2 indent-8 justified-paragraph">
						Time flew by. Despite Yolanda's slight limp, life
						remained calm and peaceful. On November 19, 2023,
						Yolanda turned 5 years old and history repeated itself.
						Although it was winter and she wore thick clothes, it
						did not help at all. While playing at home, Yolanda fell
						and broke her left thigh once again. This time, it was
						not entirely unexpected, as routine X-rays had shown the
						deformity in her left collum femoris (upper end of her
						femur) and I had the feeling that it might cause problem
						one day. We rushed her to the hospital, faced the same
						dilemma of whether to opt for surgery or not. Luckily
						this time, after hearing about my daughter's situation,
						a patient's father in the chat group recommended his
						son's doctor to me. It was also a coincidence that the
						doctor just transferred his work to a hospital near us
						(from a hospital 1000 km away to a hospital 200 km away)
						two months before. So we transferred Yolanda to this
						hospital, where she underwent surgery on Nov 27th and an
						intramedullary lengthening nail were used to join and
						strengthen her left thighbone. The picture on the right
						shows her left thighbone after the surgery. Yolanda was
						discharged on Dec 2nd and rested on bed until March
						2024.

				She has made good progress in her recovery and is now able to
				walk. During her recent hospital visit, the medication used for
				injections was updated as the previous medication was no longer
				effective in supporting her body. Continuing to use the old
				medication may result in the protrusion of the nail implant.
